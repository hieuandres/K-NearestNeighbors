## Introduce
K-nearest Neighbor is a Non parametric ,lazy and supervised machine learning algorithm used for both Classification and Regression.
Uses the phenomenon “similar things are near to each to each other” .
It predicts the class of the new data point by majority of votes of k nearest neighbors based on the similarity measure(ie., distance functions).
Varying the value of K ,differs the prediction class.
It is commonly used for its easy of interpretation and low calculation time.
